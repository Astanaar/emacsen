Goal: 
       To run Aquamacs + Emacs (emacsforosx.com) as well as Clojure + Common Lisp (ccl+sbcl)

Do not use elpa because it's a pain to setup a new machine, plus versions change. Or, don't keep elpa in ~/ directory.

I prefer to download elisp and make a conf file for each plugin/vendor separately.

With macports/ESK-derived .emacs.d Aquamacs (latest, 2.2+) runs fine, but C-Q quit is broken because of an ido-file-history error.

Plus, I would like to have quicklisp-slime-helper setup with Aquamacs + latest slime and use the standard ESK slime for clojure.



Option A.
 	 	Shell script run-aqua that hides .emacs.d -> cannot work, I need both running simultaneously.

Option C.
 		Aquamacs runs thru Preferences.el that sets up either an aquamacs-starter-kit and/or a nandan-emacs-config
		Macports does the same, but through a custom load-path, setup through a -l loadfile that loads emacs-starter-kit and/or a nandan-emacs-config
		nandan-emacs-config is a directory with vendors/ configs/ and load-foo.el where load-foo.el is the loads required for a particular emacs,
		eg load-clojure-aquamacs.el load-commonlisp-emacs.el etc. -- they load a common, minimal initfile (for require 'cl etc) and then
		a set of vendor+config files.

		This way it's easy to also try out aquamacs-standard-kits etc.
